## CustomCrops Resource Pack Bedrock Edition 
- [English](README.md)
- [简体中文](README.zh_CN.md)

### ❕Because of the study problem, I need to be disconnected from the Internet for a year.  

This project was created for the Minecraft server plugin CustomCrops to provide Geyser display support for friends using CustomCrops.   

During the time I was using geyser, I learned from the documentation on wiki.bedrock.dev and the java2bedrock resource pack. Many friends also helped me improve, and I hope this resource pack can help newbies like me.   

## How to use it
Modify the custom model data and block state in mappings to what your server requires.   
Put the mappings file into the custom_mappings folder.   
Put the resource pack into the packs folder.    
Changed the item frame of customcrops furniture to an armor stand. (in itemsadder)
